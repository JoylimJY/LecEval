Crucially, by projecting both the query and the key into spaces designed to maximize this similarity measure, we assure that the resulting attention weights accurately reflect the intended relationships.&#10;&#10;Transformers apply this self-attention process across all words in a sentence, enabling each word to become contextually informed by the rest, rather like how pixels in an image might influence one another in computer vision.&#10;&#10;In summary, Transformer self-attention involves casting each word into a space where it can 'query' the relevance of all other words, enabling the model to construct a fully contextualized representation of each word within the larger context of the sentence.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

For our example, that's a sequence with 21 vectors (6 language  5 visual  10 acoustic).&#10;&#10;3. **Add Positional Information:**&#10;   - Use position embeddings to give each vector information about its place in the sequence. This is straightforward with language where the sequence is natural, but what about cross-modality?&#10;   - For visual and acoustic inputs, you might also use positional embeddings with another dimension indicating their place in the sequence, maintaining the order within each modality.&#10;&#10;4. **Introduce Modality Embeddings:**&#10;   - To help the Transformer distinguish between different types of input, you can assign an additional modality embedding (such as a simple one-hot encoded vector) to each vector. A language token might get [1, 0, 0], an image frame [0, 1, 0], and an acoustic feature [0, 0, 1].&#10;   - Project these modality embeddings to a space compatible with the input embeddings and add them to the corresponding vectors.&#10;&#10;5. **Run the Combined Sequence Through the Transformer:**&#10;   - Feed the long sequence of vectors, now rich with both positional and modality information, through the Transformer.&#10;   - It processes the whole sequence, allowing each part to attend to all others and building a contextual understanding that spans across modalities.&#10;&#10;6. **Extract Modality-Specific Embeddings:**&#10;   - After processing, you can take segments of the Transformer's output corresponding to each original input type. For example, segments of 6, 5, and 10 for language, visual, and acoustic, respectively.&#10;&#10;7. **Train or Apply the Model:**&#10;   - With the model trained, you can use it for different multimodal tasks, where it will leverage the interactions between the modalities to make better-informed predictions or analyses.&#10;&#10;With this setup, you might wonder if changing the order of inputs (language, visual, acoustic) would impact the model.

For our example, that's a sequence with 21 vectors (6 language  5 visual  10 acoustic).&#10;&#10;3. **Add Positional Information:**&#10;   - Use position embeddings to give each vector information about its place in the sequence. This is straightforward with language where the sequence is natural, but what about cross-modality?&#10;   - For visual and acoustic inputs, you might also use positional embeddings with another dimension indicating their place in the sequence, maintaining the order within each modality.&#10;&#10;4. **Introduce Modality Embeddings:**&#10;   - To help the Transformer distinguish between different types of input, you can assign an additional modality embedding (such as a simple one-hot encoded vector) to each vector. A language token might get [1, 0, 0], an image frame [0, 1, 0], and an acoustic feature [0, 0, 1].&#10;   - Project these modality embeddings to a space compatible with the input embeddings and add them to the corresponding vectors.&#10;&#10;5. **Run the Combined Sequence Through the Transformer:**&#10;   - Feed the long sequence of vectors, now rich with both positional and modality information, through the Transformer.&#10;   - It processes the whole sequence, allowing each part to attend to all others and building a contextual understanding that spans across modalities.&#10;&#10;6. **Extract Modality-Specific Embeddings:**&#10;   - After processing, you can take segments of the Transformer's output corresponding to each original input type. For example, segments of 6, 5, and 10 for language, visual, and acoustic, respectively.&#10;&#10;7. **Train or Apply the Model:**&#10;   - With the model trained, you can use it for different multimodal tasks, where it will leverage the interactions between the modalities to make better-informed predictions or analyses.&#10;&#10;With this setup, you might wonder if changing the order of inputs (language, visual, acoustic) would impact the model. Due to self-attention's nature, as long as positional and modality embeddings are properly assigned, the Transformer should still understand and process the inputs correctly, regardless of the order. However, consistency in input ordering may benefit training stability and performance.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

When you're ready to apply BERT to a specific task?like sentiment analysis?fine-tuning it is the next step.&#10;&#10;Fine-tuning is relatively straightforward. Here's how you can approach it:&#10;&#10;1. **Use the Pre-trained Model as a Starting Point**: Begin with the already trained BERT model, which understands language well due to the unsupervised learning it underwent.&#10;&#10;2. **Add Your Task-Specific Layers**: Attach a few additional layers that are suited for sentiment analysis. This might simply be a classification layer that can judge the sentiment of a given text.&#10;&#10;3. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Gather a labeled dataset for sentiment analysis, where the documents you want to evaluate are marked with their respective sentiments.&#10;&#10;4. **Adjust Model Parameters**: During fine-tuning, your task-specific layers will learn from the labeled examples, but you'll also make slight adjustments to the parameters within BERT's original layers. This helps tailor the pre-trained model to understand sentiment in the context of your specific dataset.&#10;&#10;5. **Train on Your Task**: Run your sentiment-labeled dataset through the fine-tuned model. This involves feeding the documents into BERT, which uses its learned language patterns to process the text, and then letting the additional layers you've added specialize in classifying sentiment.&#10;&#10;6. **Evaluate and Iteratively Improve**: After training, assess the model?s performance on a test set and refine your approach if necessary. This could mean adding more training data, tweaking the network structure, or adjusting learning rates, among other factors.&#10;&#10;By customizing the pre-trained BERT with data from your task, you create a powerful tool specifically adept at sentiment analysis. With continued training and adjustments, the model can become highly accurate at evaluating the sentiment of various texts.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

For instance:&#10;&#10;- If \\(Y=0\\) and \\(Z=0\\), what's the probability that \\(X=0\\) and what's the probability that \\(X=1\\)?&#10;- If \\(Y=1\\) and \\(Z=0\\), the probabilities of \\(X\\) will again differ accordingly.&#10;&#10;Each row in this matrix must sum to 1, as it represents the complete set of possible outcomes for \\(X\\) given a particular scenario for \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\).&#10;&#10;Now, when variables are continuous instead of categorical, a CPT won't cut it. Instead, you'd look at probability density functions. For instance, you might assume a normal (Gaussian) distribution if that seems to fit your data.&#10;&#10;Deciding on the right probability distribution to use can be based on collected data, assumptions, or both. It's a design decision rooted in the specifics of the problem you are modeling. If data is scarce or you're unsure, plotting the data you have and looking for patterns can be helpful. Does the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) look like a classic bell curve of a Gaussian distribution, for example?&#10;&#10;This process, whether straightforward or requiring some assumptions, helps establish the CPDs that form the backbone of your Bayesian network's predictive power.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

Unlike traditional HMMs that assume a single hidden state sequence, factorial HMMs entertain the possibility that there's a complex, multi-layered structure to the data being modeled. Here?s how they work:&#10;&#10;1. **Multiple Hidden Layers**: In a Factorial HMM, you have several layers of hidden states, each representing an independent process or \"factor\" that influences the observations.&#10;&#10;2. **Concurrent Influence**: These factors run concurrently and each has its own Markovian property, meaning that they individually obey the Markov assumption, transitioning from one state to another over time.&#10;&#10;3. **Combination of Factors**: The observed data at any time point are a combined result of these independent factors. It's akin to having multiple musicians in a band; each plays a different instrument, contributing a unique sound that, when combined, forms a single piece of music.&#10;&#10;4. **Complexity in Decoding**: Decoding the observed data back into multiple streams of hidden states can be much more complex here because you're distinguishing multiple simultaneous sources of variation, not just one.&#10;&#10;5. **Inference Challenge**: The inference in Factorial HMMs involves unpacking the single observation stream into multiple hidden state sequences, requiring sophisticated algorithms to tease apart the intertwined influences of the multiple factors.&#10;&#10;The challenge becomes even greater as you venture beyond and consider truly multimodal data?where you not only have multiple processes at play but also different types of data feeding into the model. This expansion might involve techniques that integrate and make sense of the rich, multifaceted information that comes from varying data sources. Factorial HMMs show that complexity can be structured and modeled, providing a dynamic and flexible tool for understanding and prediction in fields like signal processing, transcript recognition, and more.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

This model's job is to differentiate between the real images from your dataset and the fake ones produced by your generator. &#10;&#10;You put the generator and discriminator against each other in a framework known as Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN. The generator learns to produce more realistic images in an effort to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator gets better at telling real images from fakes. Over time, this adversarial process improves the quality of the generated images significantly, leading to highly realistic results.&#10;&#10;This innovative setup often results in synthetic images that can be nearly indistinguishable from actual photographs, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of image generation.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

We explored how modeling the full joint distribution between variables X and Y enables us to perform a variety of tasks, such as class conditional probabilities and translations. &#10;&#10;We also looked into learning representations through generative models, like Boltzmann machines, and other unsupervised approaches. With these models, we can add just one or two layers on top to perform supervised tasks, like image retrieval\u68achich was a focus of one of the papers we studied.&#10;&#10;Then, we discussed training joint representations unsupervisedly with tools like stacked autoencoders.

One method focuses on preserving ordering. Imagine you have two embeddings\u68a0ne for text and one for images\u6890nd you want them to correspond. One way to achieve this is by ensuring a high cosine similarity between image embeddings and caption embeddings.&#10;&#10;However, you can also use a more structured approach to enforce this coordination. For instance, if both embeddings represent entities at a high level\u689dike people\u68a9hen they should be somewhat close to each other, even if one is a farmer and the other a skier. They're not identical, but they share a level of similarity because they're both people.&#10;&#10;Another technique involves using a coding mechanism, like a hashing table, which not only increases efficiency but also encapsulates some degree of similarity in its binarized form. This is an alternative method for connecting text and images that focuses on efficiency and a different representation of similarity.&#10;&#10;We could also discuss Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and other such methods, but they would require more detail.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 4, 3"}]}

This restriction can lead to more intuitive and interpretable results, especially since many types of data naturally adhere to non-negativity\u689dike images and text, where the measurable quantities (like pixel intensity or word counts) cannot be less than zero.&#10;&#10;What's appealing about NMF is that it lends itself to part-based representation. In essence, you can think of NMF as revealing the building blocks or features of your dataset and then showing how those blocks combine to form the whole. It's a way of breaking down complex, multivariate data into simpler, understandable pieces.&#10;&#10;This quality makes NMF particularly useful in fields like topic modeling, where each topic is constructed from a group of words, and each document is a mixture of these topics. It's also valuable in image processing, where NMF can identify recurring patterns or features within a set of images.&#10;&#10;Overall, the attraction to NMF stems from its ability to provide a clearer, more meaningful understanding of the data by adhering to the non-negativity constraint, aligning well with how we naturally observe and interpret the world around us.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3, 3, 4, 3"}]}

{"id": "ml-1_17_slide_008", "slide": "/images/ml-1/17/slide_008.png", "transcript": "Back in my PhD days, 20 years ago, the two dominant paradigms for multimodal fusion were early and late fusion, which are interesting to consider as two extremes. Nowadays, we're more focused on what I'd call intermediate fusion, but let?s discuss early fusion first.&#10;&#10;Early fusion is where we merge features at the earliest possible stage, almost at the raw data input level. You concatenate features and let the classifier handle the fusion. This process is somewhat akin to joint representation learning, except it happens right at the beginning. After the features are combined, if you're using a neural network, it might do some additional representation learning before classification?or regression since this approach isn't limited to classification tasks.&#10;&#10;One of the main advantages of early fusion is its simplicity: it's straightforward to implement since you can use any machine learning classifier or regressor available, even those traditional models that predate the era of multimodal AI, like linear regression. You just concatenate the features, lean on your chosen model as a black box, and hope it will uncover useful interactions within the data internally.&#10;&#10;However, a challenge with early fusion is the potential for high dimensionality.

Nowadays, we're more focused on what I'd call intermediate fusion, but let?s discuss early fusion first.&#10;&#10;Early fusion is where we merge features at the earliest possible stage, almost at the raw data input level. You concatenate features and let the classifier handle the fusion. This process is somewhat akin to joint representation learning, except it happens right at the beginning. After the features are combined, if you're using a neural network, it might do some additional representation learning before classification?or regression since this approach isn't limited to classification tasks.&#10;&#10;One of the main advantages of early fusion is its simplicity: it's straightforward to implement since you can use any machine learning classifier or regressor available, even those traditional models that predate the era of multimodal AI, like linear regression. You just concatenate the features, lean on your chosen model as a black box, and hope it will uncover useful interactions within the data internally.&#10;&#10;However, a challenge with early fusion is the potential for high dimensionality. The classifier has to handle the intricacies of the data, which can be tough, especially when the features have different levels of granularity. For instance, combining language and visual data is complex. Today, we might use word embeddings to create a vector for each word, but 20 years ago, language representation was often more symbolic, and we didn't have such convenient methods for embedding.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3, 3, 3, 3"}]}

Each classifier is trained with the label in mind; actually, they're trained for the exact task they're ultimately going to predict.

Let's take a moment to explore kernels and then circle back to see how they connect with transformers.&#10;&#10;In essence, a kernel function acts as a measure of similarity between two data points. If you have two data points and you want to assess how similar they are, you could start with a simple dot product which itself is a type of kernel function. However, in many situations, you might want to take it a step further.&#10;&#10;What kernels often do is project the data into another space, a function we might call a projection function. The hope is that by mapping your data into this new space, the similarities between data points become more pronounced and easier to discern. A kernel can take a more complex approach than just a straightforward linear projection, like we previously discussed with the transformation W.&#10;&#10;Notationally, the inner product, or the result of applying a kernel function to two vectors, is sometimes denoted with angled brackets surrounding the vectors. This notation highlights the operation being conducted in potentially different spaces. Your original data might exist in 'real-world' space, but the kernel function transports it into another space where patterns and relationships that weren't previously visible can emerge more clearly.&#10;&#10;The beauty of kernel functions is their flexibility. They allow SVMs to find separating hyperplanes in more complex, high-dimensional spaces that might not have been possible in the original input space. This concept, while used differently, relates to the transformer architecture where representations are projected into spaces where the relevant connections between elements?such as words in a sentence?are made more apparent.&#10;&#10;To give some examples of kernels, besides the linear kernel (dot product), there are polynomial kernels that map input into polynomial feature spaces, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels that measure similarity based on distance in a non-linear space. These kernels help models discern the subtler nuances between data points, enhancing their predictive power.&#10;&#10;So, as we revisit transformers, we can think about them through the lens of kernel functions.

Your original data might exist in 'real-world' space, but the kernel function transports it into another space where patterns and relationships that weren't previously visible can emerge more clearly.&#10;&#10;The beauty of kernel functions is their flexibility. They allow SVMs to find separating hyperplanes in more complex, high-dimensional spaces that might not have been possible in the original input space. This concept, while used differently, relates to the transformer architecture where representations are projected into spaces where the relevant connections between elements?such as words in a sentence?are made more apparent.&#10;&#10;To give some examples of kernels, besides the linear kernel (dot product), there are polynomial kernels that map input into polynomial feature spaces, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels that measure similarity based on distance in a non-linear space. These kernels help models discern the subtler nuances between data points, enhancing their predictive power.&#10;&#10;So, as we revisit transformers, we can think about them through the lens of kernel functions. Transformers project data (like words in a sentence) into spaces where the weights (like attention scores) reflect how elements should be considered in relation to one another, much like kernels project data points to highlight their similarities or differences.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2, 4, 4, 2"}]}

Consider \"W\" at time step \"t\" (not chronological time, but as an optimization iteration step). To update our parameters, we use the gradient and adjust our \"W\" by taking a step in the direction that reduces our loss function.&#10;&#10;This step size is critical, and we often refer to it as the learning rate. Choosing the right learning rate is crucial; it determines how large of a step we take during each iteration. It can be constant, but often we use various strategies to adjust it over time, such as learning rate decay.&#10;&#10;The learning rate might start out larger and then decrease with each iteration\u6890 technique often used to ensure more stable convergence as we get closer to the optimal values.

When labels are scarce or absent, this approach helps in training models like the CNN to recognize patterns and features by providing it with tasks like image reconstruction or solving a jigsaw puzzle from shuffled image segments.&#10;&#10;In language, self-supervised learning has gained momentum with techniques that involve hiding part of a sentence and training a model, equipped with self-attention, to predict the missing words. This is based on the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that a word's context can predict its meaning.&#10;&#10;Pre-training excites researchers because it primes models with a rich understanding of their respective data. For the CNN, this learning could start with understanding images in the supervised task, and then further refined with the self-supervised task. It allows each part of the multimodal system to build up a wealth of knowledge before they're fine-tuned together on the specific application of sentiment analysis across images and text.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

In this new space, the dynamics can be captured more effectively, enabling us to still use the conventional tools we've been discussing, but with the added richness of nonlinear relationships.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, neural networks can offer a more direct approach to learning nonlinear transformations. By training a network to find the appropriate nonlinear mapping between 'X' and 'Y', we create a deep learning framework that\u75f4 able to handle complex, nonlinear relationships inherently.&#10;&#10;These methods, whether kernel-based or utilizing neural networks, offer us a pathway to extend the time-warping concept beyond linearity, providing a more flexible and potentially more accurate model for aligning our multimodal datasets.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

While a short sentence might be entirely captured by the hidden states of the RNN, longer sequences can pose significant difficulties.&#10;&#10;If we're faced with a lengthy and complex sentence like \"I sent them the agreement of the European Union economic area which was signed in August 1992\", a simple RNN may focus more on the latter parts, potentially losing essential context from the beginning.&#10;&#10;Even if we use a bi-directional RNN, which processes the data in both directions to better capture context, we're still facing challenges. That's where attention mechanisms come into play. An attention model allows us to overcome these limitations by focusing on different parts of the sentence as needed.&#10;&#10;So, instead of relying on the RNN to remember every detail from the start of the sentence, attention directs the model's focus to the relevant segments at each step of translation, much like how you'd translate by considering each part of the sentence carefully. This nuanced approach helps improve translation performance, especially for long and elaborate sentences.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

In English, we say \"the greenhouse,\" but in French, it translates to \"la maison verte,\" which directly translates back to \"the house green.\" Attention models effectively manage these syntactic differences. &#10;&#10;Take the English term \"European Economic Area.\" In French, it's rearranged to \"zone \u9997onomique europ\u99a5nne,\" quite different in structure. Attention allows you to track this transformation across languages, showing you clearly and precisely how the model shifts focus to produce coherent translations despite these variances. This not only aids in model interpretability but also validates the model's effectiveness in capturing the essence of language structures.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

Today, we're going to cover unimodal representation, which I'm quite passionate about due to my background in computer vision. The thing about unimodal is that it deals with high-dimensional data like images. Think of it - we've gone from 640x480 resolutions to 4k nowadays. Plus, there are multiple channels in an image like RGB, which stands for the colors red, green, and blue.&#10;&#10;The basic task we might want to start with could be something simple like identifying a dog in an image, similar to how YouTube might recognize cats and dogs. So, what's the basic representation of an image? Well, if you've worked in computer vision, this might be a review, but for those from different backgrounds, here it goes: An image is essentially a matrix, or an array of numbers. For grayscale images, it's a 2D matrix, and for color images, it becomes a 3D matrix with each layer representing a color channel.&#10;&#10;Now, when we talk about image classification, the simplest approach is to take this 3D matrix and flatten it into a long 2D vector that can be fed into classifiers like neural networks or even more traditional methods like support vector machines. This process is straightforward; you're effectively stacking and concatenating all the pixel values.&#10;&#10;Concerning classification types, there's binary classification, where the result is either a '0' or '1' - say, whether or not there's a dog in the picture. Then there's multi-class classification, where an image might contain a dog, a cat, or neither. But it can only be one of those categories. Sometimes you'll encounter multi-label classification where an image might have multiple objects in it. For example, it could contain both a dog and a cat. &#10;&#10;And let's not forget about regression, where instead of categories, we're predicting continuous variables like age, height, weight, or distance.&#10;&#10;This is all foundational stuff, computer vision 101. We're starting here, and as we move forward, when I mention things like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), and you're wondering what the input 'X' is, just remember it's often just a vector or a 3D matrix of the image data we've talked about.

Today, we're going to cover unimodal representation, which I'm quite passionate about due to my background in computer vision. The thing about unimodal is that it deals with high-dimensional data like images. Think of it - we've gone from 640x480 resolutions to 4k nowadays. Plus, there are multiple channels in an image like RGB, which stands for the colors red, green, and blue.&#10;&#10;The basic task we might want to start with could be something simple like identifying a dog in an image, similar to how YouTube might recognize cats and dogs. So, what's the basic representation of an image? Well, if you've worked in computer vision, this might be a review, but for those from different backgrounds, here it goes: An image is essentially a matrix, or an array of numbers. For grayscale images, it's a 2D matrix, and for color images, it becomes a 3D matrix with each layer representing a color channel.&#10;&#10;Now, when we talk about image classification, the simplest approach is to take this 3D matrix and flatten it into a long 2D vector that can be fed into classifiers like neural networks or even more traditional methods like support vector machines. This process is straightforward; you're effectively stacking and concatenating all the pixel values.&#10;&#10;Concerning classification types, there's binary classification, where the result is either a '0' or '1' - say, whether or not there's a dog in the picture. Then there's multi-class classification, where an image might contain a dog, a cat, or neither. But it can only be one of those categories. Sometimes you'll encounter multi-label classification where an image might have multiple objects in it. For example, it could contain both a dog and a cat. &#10;&#10;And let's not forget about regression, where instead of categories, we're predicting continuous variables like age, height, weight, or distance.&#10;&#10;This is all foundational stuff, computer vision 101. We're starting here, and as we move forward, when I mention things like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), and you're wondering what the input 'X' is, just remember it's often just a vector or a 3D matrix of the image data we've talked about. Alright, let's get into it.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 3, 3"}]}

This is crucial for both written and spoken language ? with spoken language also encompassing transcriptions.&#10;&#10;In most cases, especially recently or even up until a few years ago, a basic and popular method for representing language data is one-hot encoding. This converts words into vectors based on the dictionary of our training set. Let's say we're capturing sentiment and we have the word \"humorous.\" We want to determine if it has a positive or negative connotation.&#10;&#10;So what's one-hot encoding?

Essentially, you could take this lengthy vector and attempt to predict spoken words based on segments of it. For example, you could split the vector at points of silence, a traditional approach in earlier transcript recognition systems.&#10;&#10;When we get into the details of this vector, terms like sampling rate come into play. This refers to the number of samples in one second. For instance, at 8 kilohertz (kHz), you have 8,000 samples per second, each representing the audio's amplitude at that particular fraction of a second.

But beyond these conventional uses, we're seeing a powerful application in the realm of Natural Language Processing through knowledge graphs. These structures are central to understanding complex relationships and networks?whether among people on Facebook, economic entities, or biomedical relationships.&#10;&#10;Fundamentally, a graph is composed of nodes (or vertices) and edges. Nodes represent entities, and edges convey the relationships between these entities. In more advanced graphs, you can also associate information with each node and quantify relationships or interactions through the edges?forming a data-rich network.&#10;&#10;Consider, for example, how a knowledge graph can represent entities like Pittsburgh, hockey, and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each of these entities is a node, and the edges might reflect the relationships, such as \"Pittsburgh is the city of the Pittsburgh Penguins\" and \"Penguins is a hockey team.\"The intriguing thing about graphs is how they challenge neural networks, which are comfortably wired to deal with 1D vectors, or sometimes 2D matrices. Yet, graphs aren't naturally vectorized.

But beyond these conventional uses, we're seeing a powerful application in the realm of Natural Language Processing through knowledge graphs. These structures are central to understanding complex relationships and networks?whether among people on Facebook, economic entities, or biomedical relationships.&#10;&#10;Fundamentally, a graph is composed of nodes (or vertices) and edges. Nodes represent entities, and edges convey the relationships between these entities. In more advanced graphs, you can also associate information with each node and quantify relationships or interactions through the edges?forming a data-rich network.&#10;&#10;Consider, for example, how a knowledge graph can represent entities like Pittsburgh, hockey, and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each of these entities is a node, and the edges might reflect the relationships, such as \"Pittsburgh is the city of the Pittsburgh Penguins\" and \"Penguins is a hockey team.\"The intriguing thing about graphs is how they challenge neural networks, which are comfortably wired to deal with 1D vectors, or sometimes 2D matrices. Yet, graphs aren't naturally vectorized. They represent data that doesn't fit neatly into these formats, which raises the question: how do we adapt neural architectures to manage the complexity of graphs?&#10;&#10;New neural models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are explicitly designed for this purpose.

Imagine you're training a neural network on a dataset of 1,000 images, and you're currently looking at one whose true label is dog. &#10;&#10;Now, if your model is performing well, you'd expect the score for 'dog' to be the highest amongst all the scores. But let's say your model gives high scores to both 'dog' and 'cat.' That's where we need to adjust the weights in our model. We do this based on feedback from what's called a loss function. &#10;&#10;The loss function is essentially a score that tells you how unhappy you are with the model's predictions. It evaluates the difference between the predicted scores and the actual labels. The goal is to have a loss function that outputs a single number, which we try to minimize during training. &#10;&#10;By minimizing the loss, which often ranges from 0 to 1, we're telling the algorithm precisely how to adjust the weights. We're looking for a way to interpret these scores and 'normalize' them, ensuring that our model can confidently predict the correct class with high scores and minimize the scores for all incorrect classes. This process of tweaking the weights, guided by the loss function, is a fundamental part of training a classifier to improve its accuracy over time.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

The linear classifier calculates a weighted sum of the inputs, and the activation function then determines if the neuron should activate, influencing the network's output. Together, they enable the network to tackle complex patterns by deciding how signals should flow through the network.

Obtain Embedding: Feed the input features 'X' of a node through the graph neural network to generate the embedding 'Z' for node 'A'.&#10;&#10;2. Add Supervised Layer: Attach a supervised learning layer on top of your graph neural network. This layer uses the embeddings to perform a specific task, such as classification, and is equipped with its own set of parameters, or weights.&#10;&#10;3. Loss Calculation: Implement your chosen loss function to calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual label. In the case of binary classification, compare the predicted probability against the true class label of 'A'.&#10;&#10;4. Backpropagation: Use the loss to perform backpropagation, adjusting not only the weights of the supervised layer but also the weights of all preceding layers in the graph neural network, including both Layer 1 and Layer 2, regardless of the number of layers you have.&#10;&#10;5. Multi-Class Extension: While the example given focuses on binary classification, the same principles apply to multi-class problems. The only difference is that you'll switch to a loss function suitable for multi-class classification, like categorical cross-entropy, and your supervised layer will output probabilities for each class label instead of just two.&#10;&#10;In summary, you operationalize the embeddings for supervised learning by appending a classification layer to your graph neural network and applying an appropriate loss function, iteratively optimizing all network parameters?including those in each layer of the network?to improve your model's performance on the task at hand, be it binary or multi-class classification.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2, 3, 4, 1"}]}

Primary research questions involve determining the best ways to recognize emotional states and understanding the multimodal nature of affective signals.&#10;&#10;Key datasets used in this area encompass collections of annotated images and videos that capture a range of emotional expressions, often paired with physiological data or voice recordings that can provide additional context to the observed emotional states. One popular dataset is the Facial Recognition Technology (FER) database, which contains a vast array of facial expressions labeled with corresponding emotions. Similarly, audio datasets like the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional transcript and Song (RAVDESS) include recorded voice samples aimed at expressive analysis.&#10;&#10;Past course projects have ventured into applications like emotion-aware chatbots, which can read a user's emotions through their text, transcript, or video input and respond with empathy. Projects might also integrate wearable technology to measure heart rate and skin conductance, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the user's emotional state for healthcare applications or even targeted marketing.&#10;&#10;Exploration of these topics helps students define the standards for affective computing and informs them of how multimodal data can enhance our understanding of human emotions.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 3, 2"}]}

The NoXI dataset is a significant contribution in this space, derived from a French TV show, where the emotions of each character are annotated individually. This detailed approach allows for the study of complex emotional dynamics that occur in group interactions, such as conversations, where every participant may express and influence emotions differently.&#10;&#10;The NoXI dataset enables researchers to dissect not just the collective emotional atmosphere but also to track and model each character's emotional journey throughout the conversation. In this context, for instance, one character might consistently exhibit positive emotions like joy and surprise, whereas another might primarily display anger.&#10;&#10;Addressing your query about combining emotional states over time using facial landmarks, gestures, eyes, and other nonverbal cues across multiple frames ? it is certainly a valid consideration in emotion recognition. In fact, emotions are often expressed as a sequence over time rather than a single frame snapshot. Frame-level emotion labels can be beneficial when they capture transient emotional expressions with precision. However, for capturing the evolving and dynamic nature of emotions, it might be more effective to consider time windows or sequences of frames. This approach can provide a more accurate representation of the emotional state, taking into account the temporal continuity and context inherent in real-life interactions.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

Determining what constitutes a good or bad caption is complex because there is a tremendous variety in how humans might describe an image, and many of these descriptions could be considered reasonable even if they don't exactly match the captions in the dataset. As a solution, creators of datasets such as MS COCO also provide an evaluation server.&#10;&#10;The purpose of this evaluation server is to offer a standardized means of assessing the quality of generated captions. It aims to compare candidate sentences against a set of reference or ground truth sentences. This comparison can be carried out using both automated evaluation metrics and human judgment to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation process. The availability of such an evaluation mechanism encourages the development of captioning models that are not strictly bound by supervised learning paradigms, which might otherwise limit the diversity of acceptable captions. This approach fosters the creation of models capable of producing a wide array of valid captions, aligning more closely with the varying perspectives humans bring to image description.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 2"}]}

In complexity theory, verifying a solution to an NP-hard problem is notably easier than actually solving the problem. This analogy suggests that verifying the accuracy of a generated image caption could be simpler and possibly more efficient than the caption generation process itself.&#10;&#10;If you find this area of research engaging, especially in the context of image captioning, it could be a highly rewarding topic to explore for an academic project. There's a breadth of related work in this domain that could offer insights and foundational knowledge to support your investigation. Delving into this could not only contribute to your learning but also potentially advance the field by developing more effective methods for evaluating caption quality.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3, 3, 3, 2"}]}

In this setup, the AI agent receives textual instructions such as \"go to the green short pillar,\" and it must interpret and follow these instructions within the game's map. The agent's objective is to find and navigate to the specified pillar, and it is only upon successfully reaching the correct location that the agent is rewarded with a positive score of . Otherwise, the agent receives zero reward.&#10;&#10;The crux of the task is for the model to thoroughly comprehend the provided instructions, requiring an understanding of various concepts like colors, objects, and sizes (\"green,\" \"pillar,\" \"short\"). Grounding these entities in the game environment is crucial, meaning that the agent must accurately identify which in-game components correspond to the terms mentioned in the instructions. The model should then translate this understanding into appropriate in-game actions to complete the instruction accurately. The challenge is not only in understanding individual words but also in grasping their relational context within the visual setting of the game.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 4, 2"}]}

{"id": "ml-1_15_slide_006", "slide": "/images/ml-1/15/slide_006.png", "transcript": "In reinforcement learning, the main objective is pretty straightforward?it's all about maximizing rewards. As an agent moves through different states and takes various actions, it?s trying to rack up as many rewards as possible. You can think of it like playing a video game where the goal is to get the highest score.&#10;&#10;Here's how it works: When the agent takes an action and transitions to the next state, it receives a reward. What the agent aims to do is accumulate a total reward that is as large as possible over the series of actions and states?this is sometimes called the return. To calculate the return, we sum up all the rewards that the agent would collect over time.&#10;&#10;Now, we also use something called a discount factor, usually represented by the symbol gamma. This discount factor is applied to future rewards, making them worth slightly less than immediate rewards. Imagine if I promised you $100 now versus $100 a year from now?you'd probably prefer to have it right now, right? That's the idea behind discounting future rewards.&#10;&#10;The size of the discount factor, which is a number between 0 and 1, can change your strategy. If gamma is close to 0, the agent mostly cares about what's happening right away, trying to grab immediate rewards. If gamma is closer to 1, the agent places more value on the rewards it can get in the future, and it might pass up smaller, immediate rewards for bigger ones down the line.&#10;&#10;Regarding your question on how to keep actions relevant to the goal, it's important to have a good starting point. The initial state needs to be informative enough so that the agent knows what it's supposed to be doing right from the get-go. This helps ensure that the subsequent actions it takes are aligned with achieving the overarching goal. By properly setting the initial state and maintaining that context throughout the series of actions, we help guide the agent toward the desired outcome.", "rate": {"content_relevance": [5, 4, 4], "expressive_clarity": [4, 5, 4], "logical_structure": [4, 4, 3], "audience_engagement": [3, 3, 3]}, "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Instructions:\n\nYou are provided with a segment of a lecture slide and its corresponding transcript.

What the agent aims to do is accumulate a total reward that is as large as possible over the series of actions and states?this is sometimes called the return. To calculate the return, we sum up all the rewards that the agent would collect over time.&#10;&#10;Now, we also use something called a discount factor, usually represented by the symbol gamma. This discount factor is applied to future rewards, making them worth slightly less than immediate rewards. Imagine if I promised you $100 now versus $100 a year from now?you'd probably prefer to have it right now, right? That's the idea behind discounting future rewards.&#10;&#10;The size of the discount factor, which is a number between 0 and 1, can change your strategy. If gamma is close to 0, the agent mostly cares about what's happening right away, trying to grab immediate rewards. If gamma is closer to 1, the agent places more value on the rewards it can get in the future, and it might pass up smaller, immediate rewards for bigger ones down the line.&#10;&#10;Regarding your question on how to keep actions relevant to the goal, it's important to have a good starting point. The initial state needs to be informative enough so that the agent knows what it's supposed to be doing right from the get-go. This helps ensure that the subsequent actions it takes are aligned with achieving the overarching goal. By properly setting the initial state and maintaining that context throughout the series of actions, we help guide the agent toward the desired outcome.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 3, 3"}]}

This equation sets up what's basically a puzzle, involving all the known elements, which are your immediate awards and probabilities for moving from one state to the next.&#10;&#10;Imagine each state's value as a piece of the puzzle you're trying to find. Now, you know how the pieces fit together (that?s the Bellman Equation telling you the relationship between one piece and another), but you want to see the full picture.&#10;&#10;Since the probabilities of moving from state to state (like the branches on the tree), the rewards for landing on them (the fruits), and the way you're likely to pick your next action (your policy) are pretty much set in stone (like constants), you can turn the whole thing into a linear system. This just means every piece's position is affected in a consistent way by the pieces around it.&#10;&#10;Now, you're going to solve this puzzle?figure out the value of each state, ideally in a perfect world, in one go. But since we can't always see the future that clearly, you can use a clever trick: start with a guess and keep adjusting it. You might say, \"I think this puzzle piece should go here,\" and then you use the rules of the puzzle (the Bellman Equation) to check and refine your guess. Each time you do, you get a clearer picture of where each piece actually fits.&#10;&#10;So, by using this iteratively, where 'k' is kinda like saying \"attempt number\", you begin with a guess (k), use the puzzle?s rules to make a better guess (k), and repeat. This process nudges your picture closer to how it should really look, and eventually, you end up with the actual scores (values) for every state according to your policy.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this? If your assumptions about the rewards and how you move through the states (transitions) are correct and you can calculate all these sums, you can figure out these scores (state values) exactly. It might take a bunch of iterations, but just like solving a puzzle, each move gets you a step closer to the complete picture?the optimal value for every state!\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

{"id": "ml-1_15_slide_028", "slide": "/images/ml-1/15/slide_028.png", "transcript": "Alright, let's break it down to the essentials. Remember how we talked about optimizing your game plan? We're still on that track, except now it's all about zeroing in on the best possible moves directly. We're no longer just taking averages based on different actions under a given policy; we're hunting down the very best action, period. This is where the term \"Bellman optimality equations\" comes into play. It?s an elite strategy that always aims for the ultimate play.&#10;&#10;You've got two key players here: your 'V*' for the current state 's', and 'V*' for the next state 's prime'. You're looking to buff up these values as much as you can. Starting out, you give 'V*' some initial numbers, like setting the scoreboard before the game begins. Now, the real fun starts.&#10;&#10;Imagine you've got the values on the right side, and you're looking to update the score on the left. It's like a classic before-and-after scenario. You take all that good info from the right, make your calculations, and voil\u00e0, you've got a fresh value. Then, it's just a matter of rinse and repeat?take the updated score on the left, toss it back to the right side, and run the numbers again for an even newer update.&#10;&#10;This back-and-forth action, this iterative process, keeps the ball rolling. You're essentially leapfrogging from one value to the next, always pushing forward.

Remember how we talked about optimizing your game plan? We're still on that track, except now it's all about zeroing in on the best possible moves directly. We're no longer just taking averages based on different actions under a given policy; we're hunting down the very best action, period. This is where the term \"Bellman optimality equations\" comes into play. It?s an elite strategy that always aims for the ultimate play.&#10;&#10;You've got two key players here: your 'V*' for the current state 's', and 'V*' for the next state 's prime'. You're looking to buff up these values as much as you can. Starting out, you give 'V*' some initial numbers, like setting the scoreboard before the game begins. Now, the real fun starts.&#10;&#10;Imagine you've got the values on the right side, and you're looking to update the score on the left. It's like a classic before-and-after scenario. You take all that good info from the right, make your calculations, and voil\u00e0, you've got a fresh value. Then, it's just a matter of rinse and repeat?take the updated score on the left, toss it back to the right side, and run the numbers again for an even newer update.&#10;&#10;This back-and-forth action, this iterative process, keeps the ball rolling. You're essentially leapfrogging from one value to the next, always pushing forward. Each iteration, labeled 'k', 'k', 'k', is like a stepping stone leading you closer to that polished set of values, the 'V*' that tells you the max reward you can bag from every state.&#10;&#10;So you see, this algorithm we're talking about, it keeps the essence of policy iteration, but it streamlines the process. It's less about flipping back and forth between evaluating and improving a policy and more about honing in on the best move from the get-go until you reach that sweet spot where every move is just right.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

But if you're dealing with a ton of states or continuous actions, like you're in a video game with super detailed graphics or you need to control something super precise, then tabular Q-learning starts to stumble. It just can't handle that level of complexity or detail.&#10;&#10;And here's another head-scratcher: this method is great at learning from what it's seen?places it's been, actions it's taken. But throw it into a brand-new state it's never seen before, and it doesn't have a clue. It can't make that leap and guess what to do based on similar situations because, well, it's all about the specifics it's already encountered.&#10;&#10;That's why we often look to fancier techniques for more complex and nuanced tasks?ones that need the skill to make educated guesses and can cope with a whole universe of possible states and actions.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 4, 3"}]}

{"id": "ml-1_15_slide_048", "slide": "/images/ml-1/15/slide_048.png", "transcript": "Absolutely, with games like Breakout, you can't just look at a single frame to nail the gameplay. You see, knowing the position of the ball at one instant isn't enough; you need to understand the direction it's headed?up, down, or angled across the screen. The trajectory is key because it informs your agent how to move the paddle, predicting where the ball will be next and how to keep it bouncing back to break those bricks.&#10;&#10;So what we do is we riff on a clever trick called frame stacking.

The trajectory is key because it informs your agent how to move the paddle, predicting where the ball will be next and how to keep it bouncing back to break those bricks.&#10;&#10;So what we do is we riff on a clever trick called frame stacking.

{"id": "ml-1_15_slide_063", "slide": "/images/ml-1/15/slide_063.png", "transcript": "Now let's talk about policy gradient methods. These are a class of reinforcement learning techniques that operate by directly adjusting the parameters of the policy to better align actions with higher rewards. Instead of directly learning the value of the best action, they focus on improving the probabilities of taking various actions in such a way that outcomes are optimized.&#10;&#10;The beauty of policy gradients is that they're versatile. They can handle high dimensional action spaces or complex policies that might change in stochastic ways?that is, in unpredictable, random ways. This is especially useful when we're talking about systems that have to adapt to environments where uncertainty or a wide range of actions are at play.&#10;&#10;A key benefit of policy gradient methods is that they can naturally learn to balance exploration with exploitation.

These are a class of reinforcement learning techniques that operate by directly adjusting the parameters of the policy to better align actions with higher rewards. Instead of directly learning the value of the best action, they focus on improving the probabilities of taking various actions in such a way that outcomes are optimized.&#10;&#10;The beauty of policy gradients is that they're versatile. They can handle high dimensional action spaces or complex policies that might change in stochastic ways?that is, in unpredictable, random ways. This is especially useful when we're talking about systems that have to adapt to environments where uncertainty or a wide range of actions are at play.&#10;&#10;A key benefit of policy gradient methods is that they can naturally learn to balance exploration with exploitation. Since they're designed to adjust the probability distribution of actions, it's easier for them to try out new actions that may lead to better rewards in the future. &#10;&#10;Take, for instance, an autonomous drone learning to navigate through a forest.

So far, we've tackled several critical challenges, beginning with representation. We've looked into George representation and coordinated representations, exploring various methods of capturing and encoding information. Remember, we're not quite finished with representation yet; we'll delve deeper into learning representations with our upcoming discussion on variational autoencoders.&#10;&#10;In our pursuit of understanding representation, it's crucial to represent multimodal data efficiently, taking into account the complementarity between different modalities. Successfully handling this task will significantly address our second challenge: alignment.

So far, we've tackled several critical challenges, beginning with representation. We've looked into George representation and coordinated representations, exploring various methods of capturing and encoding information. Remember, we're not quite finished with representation yet; we'll delve deeper into learning representations with our upcoming discussion on variational autoencoders.&#10;&#10;In our pursuit of understanding representation, it's crucial to represent multimodal data efficiently, taking into account the complementarity between different modalities. Successfully handling this task will significantly address our second challenge: alignment. We?ve seen how data from different modalities can be brought into sync, particularly through attention-based models like self-attention mechanisms. We've also reviewed techniques tailored for time series, like dynamic time warping and its extensions, offering us a robust approach to aligning sequential information.&#10;&#10;Just last week, we examined translation models, where I highlighted the module networks as a notable example of this concept. We've learned that effective translation builds upon solid representation and alignment; these two elements are foundational for successful translation processes.&#10;&#10;Now, in lecture 8, we've reached a point where we push beyond representation and alignment to address the concept of fusion. This step involves melding different types of data to enable multifaceted interpretations and richer predictions. We're exploring multifaceted predictions in the vibrant realm of multimodal learning, where the integration of information from various sources can provide more comprehensive insights.&#10;&#10;Today's lecture, as well as the previous two, focus on this fusion challenge.

It?s bidirectional, meaning that it can go from image to text and from text to image, effectively understanding and converting one modality into the other.&#10;&#10;A standout finding from the research on this model demonstrates its prowess in tasks such as image retrieval. Traditionally, image retrieval systems rely heavily on image data alone. However, what makes this approach innovative is the incorporation of text during training. Instead of considering only an image's features derived from a common visual representation model like VGGNet, the image is embedded using a Boltzmann Machine, which has been trained alongside text data. This dual-data training encourages the model to align images more closely with textual context, enhancing image retrieval performance.&#10;&#10;To address the underlying question, Boltzmann Machines are a class of generative models that learn to represent complex distributions. They?re named after the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann and work by simulating a network of interconnected units or nodes, where each connection represents a potential relationship between data points. What sets them apart is their ability to discover intricate structures within the data they're trained on, making them superb for tasks requiring a deep understanding of multiple modalities in a joint representation, thereby improving tasks like image retrieval through a richer embedding that considers both image and text data.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

{"id": "ml-1_13_slide_045", "slide": "/images/ml-1/13/slide_045.png", "transcript": "In a multi-view CRF model, you're dealing with more than one type of data input; each type of input, such as audio and visual data, has its own set of hidden dynamics. The model captures the unique relationships within each modality and also learns how to integrate information across different modalities. The beauty of this model is that it facilitates a direct approach to modeling the correlation between synchronous events in different data streams. Unlike previous methods that might require cumbersome couplings, like those used with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a multi-view CRF can naturally model these interdependencies through potential functions. To understand how this works, consider a multi-view CRF designed to give you the probability of an output Y, given two types of input data, Xa (audio) and Xb (visual), along with a set of training parameters ?. This model interprets the relationship between the audio and visual components by integrating over all possible hidden states that might explain the observed data.

The model captures the unique relationships within each modality and also learns how to integrate information across different modalities. The beauty of this model is that it facilitates a direct approach to modeling the correlation between synchronous events in different data streams. Unlike previous methods that might require cumbersome couplings, like those used with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a multi-view CRF can naturally model these interdependencies through potential functions. To understand how this works, consider a multi-view CRF designed to give you the probability of an output Y, given two types of input data, Xa (audio) and Xb (visual), along with a set of training parameters ?. This model interprets the relationship between the audio and visual components by integrating over all possible hidden states that might explain the observed data.

In the medical field, for instance, electroencephalography (EEG) sensors provide insights into brain activity, while in other applications, infrared cameras and sensors capture information not visible to the naked eye. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a window into the brain's function and structure.&#10;&#10;Although the course will predominantly focus on natural language (verbal), visual, and auditory (vocal) modalities as basic building blocks, the principles discussed will often be transferable to other modalities.

From this foundational understanding of alignment, the course naturally branches into two distinct paths: translation and fusion. Both are integral to the field of multimodal machine learning, yet they serve different purposes and utilize different mechanisms.&#10;&#10;Translation, in the context of multimodality, involves converting information from one form to another\u50adut not just in the simplistic sense of changing languages. It means, for example, transforming the visual information contained in an image into textual form, as in image captioning. The key here is that the loss function is geared toward generating an output in a different modality from the input; it's about creating a bridge that allows one form of content to be expressed as another.&#10;&#10;Fusion, however, diverges from translation. In fusion, the objective isn't to translate or generate content from one modality into another. Instead, the focus is on integrating multiple modalities to infer something new\u8000omething that isn't explicitly present in any single modality. For instance, determining the emotion conveyed in a video sequence is a task that likely benefits from fusion as it requires the integration of visual cues, auditory information, and perhaps textual data to form a holistic understanding.&#10;&#10;To illustrate the concept of translation, we can look to the pioneering work in image captioning, which we will discuss more thoroughly on Thursday.

From this foundational understanding of alignment, the course naturally branches into two distinct paths: translation and fusion. Both are integral to the field of multimodal machine learning, yet they serve different purposes and utilize different mechanisms.&#10;&#10;Translation, in the context of multimodality, involves converting information from one form to another\u50adut not just in the simplistic sense of changing languages. It means, for example, transforming the visual information contained in an image into textual form, as in image captioning. The key here is that the loss function is geared toward generating an output in a different modality from the input; it's about creating a bridge that allows one form of content to be expressed as another.&#10;&#10;Fusion, however, diverges from translation. In fusion, the objective isn't to translate or generate content from one modality into another. Instead, the focus is on integrating multiple modalities to infer something new\u8000omething that isn't explicitly present in any single modality. For instance, determining the emotion conveyed in a video sequence is a task that likely benefits from fusion as it requires the integration of visual cues, auditory information, and perhaps textual data to form a holistic understanding.&#10;&#10;To illustrate the concept of translation, we can look to the pioneering work in image captioning, which we will discuss more thoroughly on Thursday. But translation encompasses more than just image-to-text conversions. It includes various types of translations across different modalities.&#10;&#10;Each path\u8449ranslation and fusion\u5e7calls for distinct approaches. While translation focuses on enabling the understanding and expressiveness from one modality in the form of another, fusion emphasizes the harmonization of modalities to deduce nuanced insights.

{"id": "ml-1_11_slide_008", "slide": "/images/ml-1/11/slide_008.png", "transcript": "Let's break down how to handle the alignment process mathematically. Imagine we have an audio signal with a frame rate of about 20 hertz from which we compute a spectrogram. Meanwhile, the phoneme rate could be around ten to twelve per second, as people may speak three or four words in that time.&#10;&#10;Our objective is to map a potentially higher number of audio frames to these phonemes, executing a many-to-one mapping. We don't have the same length for audio and phoneme sequences, so we define a space for our labels, the phonemes, and aim to achieve two primary goals. First, we need to perform the many-to-one mapping correctly. Second, we train our classifier or model\u5e7commonly using a loss such as negative log-likelihood, which is based on the probability of the phoneme scores.&#10;&#10;We might use a recurrent neural network or similar to score parts of our audio. Then we compute a normalized output, which gives us a probabilistic distribution over all possible phonemes. Although I use an example of just five phonemes for illustration, keep in mind that in reality, there are many more\u8000ometimes up to 50 or so in a given language.&#10;&#10;For each phoneme at every time step, we predict the most likely phoneme present. We also account for an additional 'blank' label, which could represent silence or another non-phoneme event. The model generates a path through these activation probabilities, and now we have to discern the spoken phonemes, accounting for repetitions and pauses.&#10;&#10;Though there might be a vast number of potential paths through the phonemes, we can efficiently compute the probability of any given path, thanks to methods akin to those used in Hidden Markov Models\u8b21hich we'll dive into more in the next lecture. Once we have the path probability, we must convert that path to a specific sequence of phonemes.&#10;&#10;This part is crucial\u8b21hile we might think to learn everything from scratch in the neural network world, we can integrate prior knowledge into our model.

Imagine we have an audio signal with a frame rate of about 20 hertz from which we compute a spectrogram. Meanwhile, the phoneme rate could be around ten to twelve per second, as people may speak three or four words in that time.&#10;&#10;Our objective is to map a potentially higher number of audio frames to these phonemes, executing a many-to-one mapping. We don't have the same length for audio and phoneme sequences, so we define a space for our labels, the phonemes, and aim to achieve two primary goals. First, we need to perform the many-to-one mapping correctly. Second, we train our classifier or model\u5e7commonly using a loss such as negative log-likelihood, which is based on the probability of the phoneme scores.&#10;&#10;We might use a recurrent neural network or similar to score parts of our audio. Then we compute a normalized output, which gives us a probabilistic distribution over all possible phonemes. Although I use an example of just five phonemes for illustration, keep in mind that in reality, there are many more\u8000ometimes up to 50 or so in a given language.&#10;&#10;For each phoneme at every time step, we predict the most likely phoneme present. We also account for an additional 'blank' label, which could represent silence or another non-phoneme event. The model generates a path through these activation probabilities, and now we have to discern the spoken phonemes, accounting for repetitions and pauses.&#10;&#10;Though there might be a vast number of potential paths through the phonemes, we can efficiently compute the probability of any given path, thanks to methods akin to those used in Hidden Markov Models\u8b21hich we'll dive into more in the next lecture. Once we have the path probability, we must convert that path to a specific sequence of phonemes.&#10;&#10;This part is crucial\u8b21hile we might think to learn everything from scratch in the neural network world, we can integrate prior knowledge into our model. In the case of CTC, the protocol is straightforward: remove the 'blanks,' and collapse repeated labels. After applying these rules, optimize to discover the most probable sequence of phonemes.&#10;&#10;In the next steps of optimization, we consider all possible phoneme sequences to find the most likely one based on our model's predictions.

Mathematically, let's visualize that each frame is encoded into a high-dimensional vector, say 300 dimensions for the sake of illustration.&#10;&#10;Firstly, let's consider one frame from sequence B. We need to determine which frame in sequence A is most similar to it. This similarity might be captured through a metric - think about something akin to cosine similarity but for embeddings. Once we've found the closest frame in sequence A, we could refer to it as our 'soft nearest neighbor'.&#10;&#10;This 'soft nearest neighbor' is a key distinction here. Unlike 'hard nearest neighbors', which would be a single most similar frame, the 'soft' approach considers a weighted average of several similar frames. This is akin to an attention mechanism: we're not fixating on a single point but allowing for a spread of similarity across multiple points.&#10;&#10;Next, we turn the process on its head. We now examine this soft nearest neighbor and compare it with all frames from sequence B to see how similar they are to it.

Mathematically, let's visualize that each frame is encoded into a high-dimensional vector, say 300 dimensions for the sake of illustration.&#10;&#10;Firstly, let's consider one frame from sequence B. We need to determine which frame in sequence A is most similar to it. This similarity might be captured through a metric - think about something akin to cosine similarity but for embeddings. Once we've found the closest frame in sequence A, we could refer to it as our 'soft nearest neighbor'.&#10;&#10;This 'soft nearest neighbor' is a key distinction here. Unlike 'hard nearest neighbors', which would be a single most similar frame, the 'soft' approach considers a weighted average of several similar frames. This is akin to an attention mechanism: we're not fixating on a single point but allowing for a spread of similarity across multiple points.&#10;&#10;Next, we turn the process on its head. We now examine this soft nearest neighbor and compare it with all frames from sequence B to see how similar they are to it. Ideally, the soft nearest neighbor should reciprocate the initial selection.&#10;&#10;However, it might happen that the soft nearest neighbor is actually closer to another frame from sequence B. In such cases, we apply a penalty. This penalty becomes a part of the loss function, aiming to minimize the distance between the frame and its soft nearest neighbor.&#10;&#10;The loss function adjusts based on the distribution of similarity\u8b21hether it's peaky, indicating a strong preference, or flat, suggesting ambiguity.

Much like the layered approach of multi-headed attention in transformers, stacked attention refers to the idea of having multiple layers of attention where the output of one layer becomes the input to the next.&#10;&#10;With stacked attention, the model can refine its focus iteratively. The first layer of attention might capture initial cues based on the question, directing the model's focus to relevant areas of the image. However, this first pass might not be perfect.

The recurrent nature of the RNN is characterized by the hidden state being influenced by both the current input and the previous hidden state (\\( H_{t-1} \\)).&#10;&#10;Mathematically, this is represented by a weight matrix \\( W \\) that transforms the input, combined with an activation function that computes the hidden state (\\( H_t \\)). The hidden state at any time \\( t \\) is then used as one of the inputs at the next time step (\\( t \\)), making the network recurrent.&#10;&#10;However, this structure can lead to the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation, where the contribution of information decays geometrically over time, making it difficult for the network to maintain long-term dependencies.&#10;&#10;An LSTM enhances this structure by introducing gates?input, output, and forget gates?which regulate the flow of information. These gates make decisions about which data should be remembered or discarded, allowing LSTMs to keep relevant information throughout the sequence and \"forget\" irrelevant data, effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient issue and allowing the network to maintain long-term dependencies. &#10;&#10;The LSTM is thus a more complex variant of the traditional RNN, capable of learning from data where the relevant context may span long intervals of time. This makes LSTMs particularly useful for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and transcript recognition, where understanding context is critical.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 3, 3, 2"}]}

The beauty of it is that the network employs shared weights across these units, ensuring consistency in how various parts of the tree are processed.&#10;&#10;Now, you might be wondering how we determine the connections within this tree, such as knowing whether 'the' should link to 'truck' or 'likes.'

Each unit, or module, within the RNN is designed to take two inputs and produce one output, effectively creating a tree structure. The beauty of it is that the network employs shared weights across these units, ensuring consistency in how various parts of the tree are processed.&#10;&#10;Now, you might be wondering how we determine the connections within this tree, such as knowing whether 'the' should link to 'truck' or 'likes.' The solution lies in syntax parsing software which we run beforehand to inform the tree structure. This is particularly useful because my goal might be to detect sentiment, and I want to leverage all of this syntactic information to do so.&#10;&#10;The first step is to obtain the syntactic structure, such as a dependency tree or a parse tree, identifying noun phrases and verb phrases. Using this parse tree, we then construct our RNN's structure. Each sentence results in a different tree, representing its unique structure.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that this approach is similar to the traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) where sequences of different lengths are handled seamlessly?as long as we understand the sentence's structure or have a special token to signal the end of the sequence.

We take actions based on the predicted probabilities, leading us to new states and new decisions in a sequence called a trajectory. Over time, through this process of action and observation, we may receive a reward, informing us about the quality of actions taken.&#10;&#10;For positive rewards, we increase the log probability of taking those actions again, as they seem to lead to good outcomes. Conversely, for negative rewards, we attempt to decrease the log probability of those actions. This action-assessment is combined with discounting future rewards using a factor \\( \\gamma \\), thereby weighting more immediate actions more heavily.&#10;&#10;This forms the basis of a simple algorithm: initialize a policy network with random parameters, collect many rollouts by sampling actions according to the current policy, and then update the probabilities to favor actions leading to positive rewards. We use gradient ascent to optimize the parameters, increasing the likelihood of actions that have yielded high rewards and decreasing the likelihood of actions that led to losses, all while considering an epsilon-greedy method for some level of random exploration.&#10;&#10;This method offers benefits over value-based approaches, like not requiring transition probabilities and predicting policies directly. After some training with this algorithm, the model can remarkably learn effective strategies to win at the game, often resulting in consistent victories against opponents.\n\nOutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "4, 4, 3, 2"}]}

Unlike soft attention, which outputs a continuous attention map ranging from 0 to 1, hard attention employs discrete latent variables, specifically 0 and 1, representing the probabilities of each state. Once you introduce sampling in your model, backpropagation through it is not possible. Therefore, we employ policy gradient methods for training.&#10;&#10;In this multimodal context, where inputs are language, visual, and acoustic, an LSTM is used to merge this information at each timestep. Hard attention gates, which are binary (0 or 1), determine the relevance of the visual modality at a specific timestep. If the visual input is deemed relevant, the gate is set to 1, allowing the information to pass; otherwise, it is set to 0.&#10;&#10;The hard attention mechanism outputs a distribution over these 0 and 1 states before sampling. As backpropagation is not feasible directly through these stochastic samples, the training involves a controller, which is essentially a policy that defines the likelihood of each state based on the visual input's perceived utility.&#10;&#10;To refine this model, a reward function is crucial.

Unlike soft attention, which outputs a continuous attention map ranging from 0 to 1, hard attention employs discrete latent variables, specifically 0 and 1, representing the probabilities of each state. Once you introduce sampling in your model, backpropagation through it is not possible. Therefore, we employ policy gradient methods for training.&#10;&#10;In this multimodal context, where inputs are language, visual, and acoustic, an LSTM is used to merge this information at each timestep. Hard attention gates, which are binary (0 or 1), determine the relevance of the visual modality at a specific timestep. If the visual input is deemed relevant, the gate is set to 1, allowing the information to pass; otherwise, it is set to 0.&#10;&#10;The hard attention mechanism outputs a distribution over these 0 and 1 states before sampling. As backpropagation is not feasible directly through these stochastic samples, the training involves a controller, which is essentially a policy that defines the likelihood of each state based on the visual input's perceived utility.&#10;&#10;To refine this model, a reward function is crucial. This function evaluates how well the model performs a specific task, like sentiment or emotion classification, based on the selected visual features. Initially, random gating might allow irrelevant features to pass, resulting in lower classification accuracy and thus a lower reward. Over time, as the model learns to filter out non-informative features and permit only useful ones, classification accuracy improves, increasing the reward and adjusting the probabilities favorably.&#10;&#10;This hard attention strategy contrasts with soft attention, which, although smoother, can sometimes focus on irrelevant areas, reducing model efficacy.
